<p>
VegGuide.org has adopted the following policy concerning copyright
infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,
17 U.S.C. 512. The contact information for VegGuide.org's Designated
Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement ("Designated
Agent") is listed at the end of this policy, and is on file with the
<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp/list/index.html">United
States Copyright Office</a>. VegGuide.org takes copyright and other
intellectual property rights very seriously. It is VegGuide.org's
policy to (1) expeditiously block access to or remove content that it
believes in good faith may contain material that infringes the
copyrights of third parties and (2) remove and discontinue service to
repeat offenders.
</p>

<h2>Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements</h2>

<p>
If you believe that content residing on or accessible through the
VegGuide.org website or service infringes your copyright, please send
a notice of claimed copyright infringement containing the following
information to the Designated Agent listed below (consult legal
counsel or refer to 17 U.S.C. 512(c) to confirm these requirements):
</p>

<ol>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act
on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly
infringed;</li>

<li>Identification of the copyrighted works claimed to have been
infringed, or if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site
are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such
works at that site;</li>

<li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or
to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or
access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably
sufficient to permit VegGuide.org to locate the material;</li>

<li>Contact information for the notifier, such as an address,
telephone number and, if available, an e-mail address;</li>

<li>A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that use of
the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the
copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>

<li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate,
and under penalty of perjury, that the notifying party is authorized
to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that is allegedly
infringed.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Once a complete and proper notice of claimed copyright infringement is
received by the Designated Agent, or if VegGuide.org otherwise comes
to believe in good faith that a video on the VegGuide.org service may
contain material that infringes copyright:
</p>

<p>
It is VegGuide.org's policy:

<ol>
<li>to remove or disable access to the content identified in the
notice of claimed infringement;</li>

<li>to notify the content provider, member or user that it has removed
or disabled access to the content; and</li>

<li>to terminate in appropriate circumstances subscribers and account
holders who are repeat infringers.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:</h2>

<p>
If the content provider, member or user believes that the content that
was removed or to which access was disabled is not infringing, or the
content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to
post and use such content from the copyright owner, the copyright
owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or
user may send a counter-notice containing the following information to
the Designated Agent listed below:
</p>

<ol>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user;</li>

<li>Identification of the content that has been removed or to which
access has been disabled and the location at which the material
appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;</li>

<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that the content provider,
member or user has a good faith belief that the material was removed
or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the
material to be removed or disabled; and</li>

<li>Content provider's, member's or user's name, address, telephone
number, and, if available, e-mail address and a statement that such
person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District
Court for the judicial district in which the content provider's,
member's or user's address is located, or if the Content provider's,
member's or user's address is located outside the United States, for
Los Angeles County, California, and that such person or entity will
accept service of process from the person who provided notification of
the alleged infringement or an agent of such person.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, VegGuide.org
may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining
party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or
cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner
files an action seeking a court order against the content provider,
member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it
restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the
counter-notice, at VegGuide.org's sole discretion.
