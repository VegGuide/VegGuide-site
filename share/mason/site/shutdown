<p>
This site will be shutting down as of Sunday, November 24. Thank you to
everyone who has contributed to the site as well as to all of our nonprofit
partners! So long and thanks for all the mock fish.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>
VegGuide was created back in 2002 to fill what I
(<a href="https://blog.urth.org/">Dave Rolsky</a>, the site creator) and
several others saw as a gap in online services. There were also some other
motivations you can
<a href="/site/philosophy">read about in greater detail if you're
interested</a>.
</p>

<p>
The site did get some traction and did have quite a bit usage, particularly
from 2008-2015, when the bulk of the entries currently on the site were added.
</p>

<p>
However, traffic to the site has been declining for many years, and continues
to do so. <strong>But even more importantly, contributions to the site have
also declined, so the data on the site is becoming increasingly stale and out
of date. My feeling is that the site is probably now a net negative because it
often directs people to businesses that no longer exist.</strong> This is
especially true outside of North America, but even in North America most of
the listings are old and not well-maintained.
</p>

<p>
I think there are a number of factors that led to VegGuide becoming much less
relevant.
</p>

<p>
Probably first and foremost is the rise of mobile devices and apps. A huge
amount of people's internet activity has moved to their phones and apps. We
never had a full-featured app and we don't have a mobile-friendly web design,
all of which certainly hurt usage quite a bit.
</p>

<p>
In addition, very well-funded commercial entities like Yelp and Google Maps
have done a better and better job of serving the same niche that we
serve. When traveling over the last few years I've found Google Maps to be
quite helpful in finding vegan food, and I turn to it before VegGuide or
HappyCow more and more.
</p>

<p>
My own increasingly limited interest in working on the code behind the site
didn't help either. The code base uses some technologies that I developed in
the late 1990s and early 2000s. I really started hating to deal with those
technology choices over time, but switching off them was quite
difficult. Also, as I've aged I've also noted that my stamina for working on
large volunteer coding projects by myself has greatly waned. I still enjoy
working on hobby projects, but I'm much better at completing smaller
efforts. Moving VegGuide to a modern technical footing was one of those big
projects I just couldn't get done.
</p>

<p>
That all said, I think it had a good run, and I'm proud of what the site
accomplished and I think creating it was a net good for animals and the
movement.
</p>

<h2>Shutdown Plan</h2>

<p>
I will continue to renew the domain name. My plan for the domain is to turn it
into a static site that just does the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Documents some of the history and reasoning above.</li>
  <li>Points people to Google Maps, Yelp, and HappyCow as viable alternatives.</li>
  <li>
    Points people to the site's code and a sanitized version of the data in
    case anyone is interested.
  </li>
  <li>
    To clarify the last point, the sanitized data will be a dump of the
    database with all private user information expunged, plus the image files
    associated with entries & users.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
I will also privately save a full, unsanitized copy of the database in case
that's ever needed but I will not share that with anyone.
