<p>
There are a lot of changes in VegGuide 3.0. The first, and most
obvious, was a major overhaul of the look and feel of the site. The
old version was a bit too programmerish. Our UI goal for VG3 is to
make the site easier to use. Specifically, we've tried to reduce the
number of links on each page, as well as using consistent link and
button styles for similar actions.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully these changes will make the site more approachable for
newcomers, and we suspect even repeat visitors may discover features
they didn't notice before.
</p>

<h2>New Stuff</h2>

<h3>Google Maps</h3>

<p>
One of the major new features in this version of VegGuide is our
deeper Google Maps integration. You can now map any listing of
entries. Thanks to John Eckman, who also worked on this feature and
provided the icons we use on map listings.
</p>

<p>
We also provide a Google Map embedded in each entry's page whenever
possible.
</p>

<p>
One of the things we're really excited about is that this feature
works in many locations all around the world. The countries included
so far are <% list_to_english( sort VegGuide::Geocoder->Countries() ) | h %>.
</p>

<h3>Listing filters</h3>

<p>
We've done a major overhaul on the filtering feature. Besides the UI
changes, you can now filter any type of listing (by region, name, or
proximity to an address).
</p>

<h3>Improved Search</h3>

<p>
Searching has been much improved. In particular, if you search by name
and your search matches both regions and entries, you'll see both
things in the results.
</p>

<h3>Ratings</h3>

<p>
Ratings in VegGuide 3.0 are now on a scale of 1 to 5, rather than 1 to
10. We also use a
<&| /lib/link/help.mas, name => 'weighted-ratings' &>weighted rating system</&>
which should make sorting a list by
rating more useful.
</p>

<h3>Users can add new regions</h3>

<p>
In the past, adding a new region required that you suggest a new
region and that a site admin add it. That was really slow, since the
one guy (uh, me) who added the new regions often didn't get around to
it. Now users can add new regions on their own. Just look for the "Add
a new region" button when you're browsing the region tree.
</p>

<h3>Everything is Bookmarkable</h3>

<p>
The URI scheme for VegGuide 3.0 has been totally redone. This means
that everything is bookmarkable, including search results, even after
applying filters, sorting, etc.
</p>

<h2>Things which are gone</h2>

<h3>Events</h3>

<p>
We removed the events feature. At one point, we had a vague idea that
VegGuide could provide an experience similar to what meetup provides,
but that would be a huge amount of work. As it stood, the events
feature was not featureful enough to be really useful, and my informal
polling suggested most people didn't use it.
</p>

<p>
Instead, VegGuide will pull the calendar feeds offered by Meetup (and
any other relevant site) to display local veg-related meetups. In
general, the site should be a better job of finding things you search
for.
</p>

<h3>Home Regions</h3>

<p>
This fairly minor feature is gone, but may return in a more robust
form in the future.
