VegGuide.Org is a project
of <a href="http://www.exploreveg.org/">Compassionate Action for
Animals</a>, a Twin Cities, Minnesota animal rights organization, in
partnership with <a href="http://www.mercyforanimals.org">Mercy for
Animals</a>. The site was designed (such as it is)
by <a href="http://www.houseabsolute.com/">Dave Rolsky</a>. Dave also
did the programming for the site, so you can blame him for all the
bugs you find.

<h2>History</h2>

<p>
The first version of VegGuide.Org went live in October of 2002 on
either waste.org or ca4a.org (I just can't remember). However, at this
time we didn't really announce the guide outside of a small circle of
users in order to give it some beta testing.
</p>

<p>
In March of 2003, the site moved to its own domain, regveg.org
(Regional Vegetarian Guide) and we started promoting it publically.
</p>

<p>
The design of the site saw various revisions until February of 2004
brought us what I consider to be VegGuide 1.0. Look at that
lovely <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040405155331/http://www.vegguide.org/">three-column
design in purple, white, and black</a>. Needless to say, this was a
look that only a geek (like me) could love.
</p>

<p>
In March of 2004, the site moved to the vegguide.org domain, which we
thought was more easily pronouncable and rememberable.
</p>

<p>
In April of 2005, we released what I consider to be VegGuide 2.0. This
was
a <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050419075716/http://www.vegguide.org/">new
color scheme and layout</a> intended to be easier to use and easier on
the eyes. Unfortunately, at the time I didn't really know a much of
anything about UI design or usability, so it was still not the most
intuitive or friendly UI.
</p>

<p>
On January 1 of 2008, we released VegGuide 3.0, the layout you're
looking at now. Besides the new UI, there are various new features,
and there was a lot of reworking of the underlying code that drives
the site. I hope that this UI is more usable and intuitive.
