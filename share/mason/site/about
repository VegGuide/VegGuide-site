<h2>History</h2>

<p>
The first version of VegGuide.org went live in October of 2002 on
either waste.org or ca4a.org (I just can't remember). However, at this
time we didn't really announce the guide outside of a small circle of
users in order to give it some beta testing.
</p>

<p>
In March of 2003, the site moved to its own domain, regveg.org
(Regional Vegetarian Guide) and we started promoting it publicly.
</p>

<p>
The design of the site saw various revisions until February of 2004 brought us
what we consider to be VegGuide 1.0. Look at that
lovely <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040405155331/http://www.vegguide.org/">three-column
design in purple, white, and black</a>. Needless to say, this was a look that
only a geek could love.
</p>

<p>
In March of 2004, the site moved to the vegguide.org domain, which we
thought was more easily pronouncable and rememberable.
</p>

<p>
In April of 2005, we released what we consider to be VegGuide 2.0. This was
a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050419075716/http://www.vegguide.org/">new
color scheme and layout</a> intended to be easier to use and easier on the
eyes. Unfortunately, at the time Dave didn't really know a much of anything
about UI design or usability, so it was still not a very intuitive or friendly
UI.
</p>

<p>
On January 1 of 2008, we released VegGuide 3.0, the layout you're looking at
now. Besides the new UI, there are various new features, and there was a lot
of reworking of the underlying code that drives the site. We hope that this UI
is more usable and intuitive.
