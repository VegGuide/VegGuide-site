<p>
Your search, "<% $search_text | h %>", looked like an address or
postal code, but doesn't seem to actually be a valid address.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you meant to
<a href="<% uri( path => '/site/search', query => { search_text => $search_text, name_only => 1 } ) | h %>"
   title="Search by name only">search by name</a>, not address?
</p>
<%args>
$search_text
</%args>

<%method page_title>
Search by Address Failed
</%method>
