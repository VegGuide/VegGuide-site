<p>
Our RSS feeds are in <a href="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/">RSS version
1.0</a> format. Our intention is to eventually move everyone over to
using our <a href="/site/rest_api">REST API</a> rather than using
these feeds, but they are not going away any time soon.
</p>

<p>
Most of the interesting content is provided via our custom RSS module,
<strong>mod_regveg</strong>.  When we talk about an "entry" in
describing the elements this module defines, we are referring to a
single database entry such as a restaurant, grocery, cofee shop, etc.
</p>

<p>
If you retrieve a location that contains other locations, then the
feed will contain all the entries for that location and the locations
it contains.  For example, the feed for <a href="/region/4">New York
City</a> contains all the entries
for <a href="/region/5">Manhattan</a>,
<a href="/region/7">Brooklyn</a>, etc.
</p>

<p>
Feeds with more than
<strong><% VegGuide::Location->DataFeedDynamicLimit() %></strong>
entries are too large to generate dynamically, so these feeds are
generated once per day.
</p>

<p>
Each <strong>&lt;item&gt;</strong> element will represent a single
entry.  The item's <strong>rdf:about</strong> attribute (and
it's <strong>link</strong> element) will be a link to the main page
for that item.  The item's <strong>title</strong> element will be the
entry's name.  The item's <strong>description</strong> element will
contain a short description for the entry (no more than 255
characters).
</p>

<p>
The <strong>mod_regveg</strong> module defines the following &lt;item&gt;
elements:
</p>

<ul>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:long-description&gt;</strong> (#CDATA) - A long
 description for the entry.  This may contain HTML.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:phone&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Entry's phone number.  The exact
 format of this phone number varies by region.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:address1&gt;</strong>  (#PCDATA) - Entry's address.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:address2&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Additional address info for
 the entry.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:neighborhood&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Entry's neighborhood.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:directions&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Directions to the entry.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:city&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Entry's city.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:region&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Entry's state/province/region.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:postal-code&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Entry's postal (zip) code.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:country&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Entry's country.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:latitude&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Entry's latitude.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:longitude&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Entry's longitude.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:home-page&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - An external link for
 the entry, which will usually be that entry's website.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:average-rating&gt;</strong> float - Average rating for
 the entry.  This may not be included if the entry has not yet been
 rated.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:rating-count&gt;</strong> integer - Number of ratings
 for the entry.  This may not be included if the entry has not yet
 been rated.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:price-range&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - The price range for
 the entry.  This will be given as a string like "12-18".  The numbers
 are in the local currency for the entry.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:price-range-number&gt;</strong> integer (1-5) - The
 price range expressed a integer from 1 to 5, with 1 being the least
 expensive and 5 being the most expensive.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:veg-level&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - How veg*n the entry
 is.  This can be one of "vegetarian-friendly", "vegan-friendly",
 "vegetarian" (which by itself implies <strong>not</strong> vegan-friendly),
 "vegetarian/vegan-friendly", or "vegan".  This element may be empty,
 in which case the entry is either none of the above, <strong>or</strong> it is
 an organization.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:veg-level-number&gt;</strong> integer (0-5) - How veg*n
 the entry is, as a number from 0-5.  These numbers mean the
 following:

  <ol>
   <li>vegetarian-friendly</li>
   <li>vegan-friendly</li>
   <li>vegetarian</li>
   <li>vegetarian/vegan-friendly</li>
   <li>vegan</li>
  </ol>

 0 means none of the above.  If an entry is for an organization (like
 an activist or social group), then this value is always 0.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:allows-smoking&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - This will be one
 of "yes", "no", or "unknown".</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:accepts-reservations&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - This will

 in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime">W3CDTF</a> format.
 This will always be given as a UTC datetime (a time zone offset of
 0:00).</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:edit-link&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Contains a URL for
 the form which allows users to edit the entry.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:edit-hours-link&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Contains a URL
 for the form which allows users to edit the entry's hours.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:read-reviews-link&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Contains a

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:write-review-link&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Contains a
 URL for the form which allows a user to write a review for the
 entry.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:region-link&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Contains a URL for
 the region in which this entry is located.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:map-link&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Contains a URL that
 links to a map for the entry.  Note that this will be to a site like
 MapQuest or MultiMap.  These sites may restrict how the links may be
 used.  Please see their Terms of Service before using these
 links.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:image-link&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Contains a URL for
 the entry's image.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:image-x&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Contains the width of
 the entry's image.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:image-y&gt;</strong> (#PCDATA) - Contains the height of
 the entry's image.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:categories&gt;</strong> - This element will consist of
 one or more <strong>&lt;regveg:category&gt;</strong> elements, each of which
 contains #PCDATA, such as "Restaurant", "Bar", "General Store",
 etc.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:cuisines&gt;</strong> - This element will consist of one
 or more <strong>&lt;regveg:cuisine&gt;</strong> elements, each of which
 contains #PCDATA like "Chinese", "Indian", etc.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:payment-options&gt;</strong> - This element
 will consist of one or more <strong>&lt;regveg:payment-option&gt;</strong>
 elements, each of which contains #PCDATA like "American Express",
 "Check", etc.  Note that it is assumed that all entries accept cash
 as a payment option.</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:is-cash-only&gt;</strong> - If this element exists, it
 will be set to "yes".</li>

 <li><strong>&lt;regveg:features&gt;</strong> - This element will consist of one
 or more <strong>&lt;regveg:feature&gt;</strong> elements, each of which
 contains #PCDATA like "Brunch", "Happy Hour", "Macrobiotic",
 etc.</li>

 <li>
 <p><strong>&lt;regveg:hours&gt;</strong> - This element will consist of a
 structure of one or more <strong>&lt;regveg:open-close&gt;</strong> elements.
 Every <strong>&lt;regveg:open-close&gt;</strong> element will always contain a
 <strong>day</strong> attribute.  This attribute is an integer from 0 to 6, with
 Sunday as 0 and Saturday as 6.
 </p>

 <p>
 This element may contain the following two attributes:
 </p>

 <ul>
  <li><strong>open</strong> (#PCDATA) - A time in hours and minutes, such as
  "08:30".  The time will always be given in 24 hour (military)
  time.</li>

  <li><strong>close</strong> (#PCDATA) - A time in hours and minutes, such as
  "13:45".  The time will always be given in 24 hour (military)
  time.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>
 Times may range from "00:00" to "23:59".  The closing time may be
 <i>earlier</i> than the opening time.  If this is the case, then it
 means that the closing time occurs on the next day.  It is also
 possible that the opening and closing time will both be "00:00", in
 which case that indicates that it is open all day (24 hours) on that
 particular day of the week.
 </p>

 <p>
  If it does not contain <strong>open</strong> and <strong>close</strong> attributes, then
  the <strong>&lt;regveg:open-close&gt;</strong> element must contain <i>one
  of</i> the following attributes:
 </p>

 <ul>
  <li><strong>closed</strong> true - If given, this attribute is always true,
  and it indicates that the entry is closed for that day of the
  week.</li>

  <li><strong>unknown</strong> true - If given, this attribute is always true,
  and it indicates that the we don't know when the entry opens or
  closes for that day of the week.  It is possible that some days
  will be listed as unknown, while others are known.</li>

 </ul>

 <p>
 Note that a given day may have multiple opening and closing times, as
 restaurants frequently close between lunch and dinner.
 </p>

</ul>

<p>
A single item will probably not contain all of these elements.  The
only elements which are guaranteed to be present are the standard RSS
1.0 elements "title", "link", and "description".
