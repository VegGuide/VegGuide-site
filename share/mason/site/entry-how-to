How to Add Entries
</%method>

<p>
Make sure the entry is not on the site already. Note that the VegGuide search
box is finnicky. (For example, a restaurant called "V-Note" will not be found
if you type in "V Note" without the dash; similar problems if you misspell
something).
VegGuide.

Find the appropriate region to add an entry. In some cases, we already have
the city in question on the site (Minneapolis, for example). In other cases,
we might not have the specific city, but we have a corresponding region/metro
area (for example, Minnetonka, MN would simply be considered part of the
existing "Twin Cities" region on VegGuide). In other cases, we don't have
anything, and the business in question is in a city or town that's far from
existing metro areas (this happens a lot in the Northeast, Midwest and parts
of Canada). In that case, you'll have to add a new region to the specific
state or Canadian province in question, and THEN add the business. A good
gauge is just look at where the town is located on Google maps to see if it's
part of a metro area, or if it deserves its own separate region, as it's far
away from any other major town.
</p>

<p>
Find the restaurant or business on Google. Many places will have websites or
FaceBook pages which you can go to, and then get all the important info
(address, phone number, "about us" description). Some businesses might already
be closed (Yelp is the most up to date in this regard) and, at that point, the
business doesn't need to be added to VegGuide.

<p>
<strong>Do not copy copyrightable material from other sites such as Happy Cow,
Yelp, etc.</strong> Copyrightable material includes descriptions, directions,
images, and any other narrative text. It does not include facts such as names,
addresses, phone numbers, website addresses, hours of operation, etc.
</p>

<p>
When adding an entry, it is particularly important to put good information
into the <strong>Summary</strong> field. This should be one sentence (5-15
words) that clearly describes this business. A good example would be "Chinese
restaurant with a large selection of mock meat dishes". A bad example would be
"Chinese restaurant". Do not end the summary field with a period and do not
write multiple sentences here. Put any additional info in
the <strong>Description</strong> field.
</p>

<p>
You <strong>do not need to mention that a restaurant does (or does not) serve
meat</strong>. Use the <strong>How Veg?</strong> field for this purpose
instead.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to enter descriptions in both English and the region's native
language. This will appear as a separate set of Summary & Description fields,
labeled something like "Basic Info in Spanish" (or whatever language is
appropriate). If you don't see separate fields for non-English
text, <strong>do not put both English and another language in the same
field</strong>. Instead, <a href="mailto:guide@vegguide.org">contact the site
administrators for help</a>. Tell us what country you're adding entries for
and we can enable non-English fields for that country.
