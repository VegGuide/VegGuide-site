<%def .editing>
<h3>How do I add or edit an entry?</h3>

<p>
Anyone can add new entries and reviews. You can also suggest changes
to existing entries. Simply click on any of the edit buttons on the
page to start.
</p>

<p>
To add new entries or edit existing data, you must be a <a
href="/user/new_user_form">registered user</a>. Once you have an
account, you will be able to add new entries, comments/reviews, and
suggest changes to existing entries.
</p>

<p>
Adding an entry is done via the <strong>Add entry</strong> button,
which is visible as you browse regions.  This link is only offered for
regions which don't contain other regions, so you won't be able to add
a new entry to Europe, instead you'll have to find the specific city.
</p>

<p>
Note that the add entry link will not be visible when you are looking
at a list of entries that is a result of searching by address or name.
</p>

<p>
To edit an existing entry, simply go to that entry's page, and use the
appropriate "Edit" button.  The editing links are located near the
thing you're editing, so the <strong>"Edit"</strong> link right under
the hours listing lets you edit the hours.
</p>

<p>
To add a review, simply click on the
<strong>Write your review</strong> button for an entry.
</p>

<p>
You can also add comments to a region, via the <strong>Add
comment</strong> button.  If you have something useful to say about a
region as a whole, as opposed to a specific entry, that's the place to
do it.
</p>
</%def>

<%def .entry_guidelines>
<h3>What are the guidelines for new entries?</h3>

<p>
<strong>If a vendor has more than one location, please enter each location
individually.</strong>
</p>

<p>
If you don't do this, we can't record phone numbers, hours, and so on
for each entry.  Additionally, the map links will not work unless each
entry has one address.  This is really important.
</p>

<p>
Also, please add the neighborhood or street to the entry's name.  For
example, in the <a href="/region/13">Twin Cities</a> region, we have
the following listings:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>Breadsmith - Edina</li>
 <li>Breadsmith - Minnetonka</li>
 <li>Breadsmith - St. Paul</li>
</ul>

<a name="cloning"></a>
<h5>Cloning</h5>

<p>
In order to make handling of vendors with multiple locations easier,
we have a "clone" feature.  Cloning an entry lets you easily copy data
from an existing entry into a new entry.  The cloned entry starts off
identical to the original, except that you must enter new address and
phone information and hours.
</p>

<a name="grammar"></a>
<h5>Grammar, punctuation, spelling, etc.</h5>

<p>
Please use <strong>correct capitalization, grammar, and punctuation</strong>
when entering names, addresses, and descriptions, etc.  Please <strong>do
not type in ALL CAPS</strong>!  TEXT THAT IS ALL CAPITALIZED IS REALLY HARD
TO READ ;)
</p>

<a name="required_data"></a>
<h5>Required data</h5>

<p>
When entering a new entry, the following data is required:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>Category - restaurant, grocer, coffee shop, etc.</li>
 <li>Name</li>
 <li>Short description - a quick blurb about the entry</li>
 <li>Level of veg friendliness - vegan, vegetarian, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>If you don't know the information for a particular field, please
leave it blank</strong>. Don't put in "unknown" or "I don't know" or
anything like that.
</p>

<p>
For all other data fields, you can simply accept the defaults.
However, there are good reasons to fill in more data.  Since the guide
can filter listings based on things like non-smoking, wheelchair
accessibility, and so on, adding more info increases the quality of
search results.  Similarly, the guide can search for entries that are
currently open, but only if you enter the hours for an entry.  Adding
address info for entries allows us to generate map links.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Do not use the same text in both the long and short description
fields.</strong> If you cannot think of something for the "Long
Description" field, it is okay to just leave it blank.
</p>

<h5>Is a given entry appropriate?</h5>

<p>
We're pretty flexible.  If an entry is likely to be of interest to
other vegetarians or vegans, you should add it.  The one thing we do
not want to see is entries added for the sole purpose of saying
they're not veg-friendly.  If everyone did that, the system would
consist almost entirely of entries telling you not to go somewhere,
which wouldn't be very useful to anyone.
</p>

</%def>

<%def .review_guidelines>
<h3>What are the guidelines for reviews?</h3>

<p>
There are only a few things that are unacceptable in reviews.  First
of all, don't insult other reviewers.  It's fine to reference another
review in your own, and to specifically disagree with it, but don't
get personal.  Similarly, no personal attacks against anyone at the
place you are reviewing.  It's okay to say a server was rude or weird,
but keep it above the belt.
</p>

<p>
Second, even if you are not 100% vegetarian, you're still very welcome
to write a review, but please only talk about the vegetarian items you
had.  If you really liked some non-vegetarian food you had, don't
mention it here.
</p>

<p>
The last guideline is for restaurant owners. The review section is not
a forum for discussion. Please do not respond to other reviews by
writing a "review" (which isn't a review).
</p>

<p>
Reviews that don't follow these guidelines may be edited or deleted.
</p>
</%def>

<%def .categories>
<h3>What do the categories for entries mean?</h3>

<p>
The categories which can be assigned are detailed below.  Remember, an
entry can have more than one category, so please choose all the ones
that are appropriate.  The categories are primarily distinguished by
what things the vendor sells.
</p>

<ul>

 <li><strong>Restaurant</strong> - any vendor that focuses on serving food (fast food
 included) and has its own tables is considered a restaurant.</li>

 <li><strong>Coffee/Tea/Juice</strong> - a vendor that focuses on serving
 non-alcoholic drinks.</li>

 <li><strong>Bar</strong> - a vendor that focuses on serving alcoholic drinks.</li>

 <li><strong>Food Court or Street Vendor</strong> - a vendor at a food court or
 on a street.  The difference between this and a restaurant is that a
 food court vendor probably doesn't have their own tables or any sort
 of table service.  Obviously, there's some overlap between this and a
 restaurant.  Use your best judgement.</li>

 <li><strong>Grocery/Bakery/Deli</strong> - a vendor that focuses on selling food
 <strong>ingredients</strong> for people to prepare themselves, or
 bakery/deli goods.</li>

 <li><strong>Caterer</strong> - a vendor that provides complete meals for people
 or groups of people.  Note that a "personal chef" service would be
 considered a caterer as well.</li>

 <li><strong>General Store</strong> - use this category for vendors that sell
 non-food products, like clothing, shoes, household products,
 etc.</li>

 <li><strong>Organization</strong> - use this for activist and social
 groups.</li>

 <li><strong>Other</strong> - use this category for vendors that don't fit
 elsewhere.  In particular, this is intended for services like salons,
 cleaning services, nutritionists, etc.</li>

</ul>
</%def>

<%def .add_region>
<h3>How do I add a new region?</h3>

<p>
There is an <strong>"Add Region"</strong> button on most
regions. Click on this to add a new region under the region you're
in. In other words, to add a new city in Arkansas, go the Arkansas
region and click on "Add Region".
</p>

</%def>

<%def .address_search_countries>
<h3>What countries are supported for address searches?</h3>

<p>
The following countries are supported:
</p>

<ul>
% for my $c ( sort VegGuide::Geocoder->Countries() ) {
 <li><% $c | h %></li>
% }
</ul>

<p>
Note that for searches in Japan and Taiwan, the address must be in the
native language, not a romanized version.
</p>
</%def>

<%def .weighted_ratings>
<h3>How do weighted ratings work?</h3>

<p>
When we say that ratings are weighted we mean that the average rating
displayed for an entry reflects more than the "simple" average of all
its ratings. In this case, we also incorporate the number of ratings
it has received into the average which is displayed.
</p>

<p>
In practice, this means that when an entry only has a few ratings, the
average rating we calculate tends be more average. Or in other words,
the fewer ratings an entry has, ther close its weighted rating is to the
average of <em>all</em> ratings in the system (currently
<% VegGuide::Vendor->AverageRating() %>).
</p>

<p>
Here's a few simple examples. If an entry receives just one rating of
5 stars, its weighted rating is <% VegGuide::Vendor->WeightedRating(
5.0, 1 ) %>. If an entry has ten ratings, nine 5 star ratings and one
1 star, then its weighted rating is
<% VegGuide::Vendor->WeightedRating( 4.9, 10 ) %>.
</p>

<p>
If an entry receives just one rating of 1 star, its weighted rating is
<% VegGuide::Vendor->WeightedRating( 1.0, 1 ) %>. If an entry has ten
ratings, nine 1 star ratings and one 5 star, then its weighted rating
is <% VegGuide::Vendor->WeightedRating( 1.4, 10 ) %>.
</p>

<p>
This means that entries with more ratings tend to end up with
both <em>higher</em> and <em>lower</em> weighted ratings, while
entries with few ratings end nearer the system-wide average rating.
</p>

<p>
The rationale behind this is that more ratings means more accuracy. If
many people love or hate a place, it's probably really good or really
bad. But if just one or two people feel strongly about a place, that's
probably no reason to think it's exceptional.
</p>

<p>
For the mathematically minded, the algorithm used for weighting is the
same one used by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a> (as of
October, 2007):

<pre>
weighted rating (WR) = (v ÷ (v+m)) × R + (m ÷ (v+m)) × C

 where:
  R = average for the entry (mean) = (Rating)
  v = number of ratings for the entry = (votes)
  m = an arbitrary number of ratings (currently <% VegGuide::Vendor->WeightedRatingMinCount() %>)
  C = the mean vote across the whole system (currently <% VegGuide::Vendor->AverageRating() %>)
</pre>

<p>
Ok, <code>m</code> isn't really an arbitrary number. IMDB uses a
system where a movie needs a minimum number of votes to have a
weighted rating at all. With the guide, this isn't really practical,
so we just picked a pretty low number. In practice, a low value
of <code>m</code> means that the amount that weighting "tweaks" the
average is relatively minimal.
</p>

</%def>

<%def .data_localization>
<h3>How does the guide handle entries for regions that use non-English languages?</h3>

<p>
When adding or editing an entry in some locations, the guide also
allows you to enter information in other writing systems.  This is
used for things like Chinese, where we want to have both a Romanized
name (like "Hao Fan") and a name in Chinese characters.  Similarly,
having the address in both forms is quite useful.
</p>

<p>
In the future, the guide may implement a more complete localization
system that allows all the data to be stored in multiple languages,
but this is a far more complex problem to solve.
</p>
</%def>

<%def .wiki_formatting>
<h3>How do I add formatted text (headers, bold, lists, etc.) to my entries and reviews?</h3>

<p>
An entry's long description, as well as user reviews and location
comments, are all formatted with standard Wiki formatting.  Please
use this sparingly, as too much formatting looks ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
This formatting works as follows:
</p>

<p>
A regular plain old paragraph.
</p>

<p>
'''Triple-quoted text is bold.'''
</p>

<p>
''Double-quoted text is italicized.''
</p>

<p>The quotes are <strong>single quotes</strong>(').</p>

<p>
[http://www.vegguide.org/] - a bare link
</p>

<p>
[http://www.vegguide.org/|VegGuide] - a link with a title.  The link and
title are separated by a vertical bar (|).
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* An unordered list item<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Another unordered list item
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. An ordered list item<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Another ordered list item
</p>

<p>Note that list items must indented at least 4 spaces.</p>

<p>
----<br />
Four or more hyphens make a line
</p>

<p>
Here's what it looks like when formatted:
</p>

<% VegGuide::Util::text_to_html( text => q{
A regular plain old paragraph.

'''Triple-quoted text is bold.'''

''Double-quoted text is italicized.''

<%def .suggestions>
<h3>How are suggestions handled?</h3>

<p>
When a user makes a suggestion for an entry, that suggestion is saved
in the system.  It is reviewed by the system admins and/or the region
maintainer(s).  They can approve or reject the suggestion.
</p>

<p>
When you make a suggestion, you have the option to ask for an email
notifying you when the selection has been accepted or rejected.  By
default, no email is sent.

<h3>Will you add [some restaurant, store, whatever]?</h3>

<p>
No.  We're very, very lazy, and creating the site itself has

<h3>Who can edit what?</h3>

<p>
There are three levels of access to the Guide:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>System admin</li>
 <li>Region maintainers</li>
 <li>Regular users</li>
</ul>

<p>
System admins can edit or delete anything on the system.  Regular
users are able to add new entries, edit entries which they submitted
originally, and edit or delete their own comments and reviews.
</p>

<p>
Finally, region maintainers are given extra privileges to administer
certain regions in the guide.  For those regions, they are able to
edit any entry, comment or review.  They can also approve or reject
changes suggested by regular users.

<h3>What is the "watch list" feature?</h3>

<p>
You can add regions to your personal watch list by clicking on the
"watch list" icon (an eye) when you are looking at a region.  Once a
week, you'll receive an email telling you what new entries have been
created for all the regions on your watch list.
</p>

<p>
If you add a region that contains other regions to your list, for
example Minnesota, then you will be notified of additions for
<i>all</i> of the regions contained in Minnesota.

</%def>

<%def .definitions>
<h3>How are "vegan", "vegetarian", etc. defined on this site?</h3>

<p>
The definitions are as follows ...
</p>

<a name="vegan"></a>
<h4>Vegan</h4>
<p>
For the purposes of VegGuide.Org, a restaurant is considered vegan if
it is possible to randomly order anything on the menu and still have
it be vegan.  For example, if everything on the menu is vegan but the
restaurant offers cheese for pasta dishes on request, then it should
still be considered a vegan restaurant.  Honey is <strong>not</strong>
considered vegan.
</p>

<p>
The point of defining a restaurant as vegan is to assure any vegan
that they can go in and order anything they want without asking
questions about the ingredients.
</p>

<p>
If you're not sure, use your best judgement.  Remember, the purpose of
this guide is to make the lives of vegetarians and vegans easier and
more pleasant, not to enforce strict standards of vegan purity on
restaurants.
</p>

<a name="vegetarian"></a>
<h4>Vegetarian</h4>
<p>
For the purposes of this web guide, a restaurant is considered
vegetarian if it does not serve animal flesh in any form.
</p>

<a name="vegan-friendly"></a>
<h4>Vegan-friendly</h4>
<p>
This categorization is far more flexible than the others, and should
be influenced by the restaurants's locale.  For example, in places
like New York City or San Francisco, which have many vegan and
vegetarian restaurants, a restaurant offering a single vegan entree
would not be considered vegan-friendly.  On the other hand, in a small
town vegan-friendly may mean a restaurant that is willing to make
pasta with marinara sauce.
</p>

<p>
Particularly in regions with limited selections for vegans, even
minimal vegan-friendliness is worth noting.
</p>

<a name="vegetarian-friendly"></a>
<h4>Vegetarian-friendly</h4>
<p>
Like vegan-friendly, the definition of this term varies by locale.  A
restaurant need not be vegetarian-friendly to be added to the guide,
though there should be some other compelling reason for adding it if
it isn't vegetarian-friendly. For example, if a restaurant has a few
veg options <strong>and</strong> serves a cuisine unique for its area,
feel free to add it.
</p>
</%def>

<%def .who_pays>
<h3>Who pays for this site?</h3>

<p>
This site has pretty low expenses at the moment.  XMission provides
our Internet connectivity, and Eric Waters provided our server.  If
you want to help out, feel free
to <a href="http://www.exploreveg.org/donate">make a donation</a> to
Compassionate Action for Animals.
</p>

</%def>

<%def .browser_support>
<h3>Why does this site look terrible in my browser?</h3>

<p>
This site was primarily designed to look good in Mozilla/Firefox and
Internet Explorer 6.0+. It should also look okay in Safari, Konqueror,
and Opera 7+. Because the site is standards-compliant, it should also
be usable in text-only browsers.
</p>

<p>
If you are using an older version of Internet Explorer or Mozilla, the
site layout may look pretty strange.  We recommend upgrading to the
latest version of <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a>
available, or at least to IE7 if you cannot use Firefox.
</p>
</%def>

</%def>

<%def .browser_localization>
<h3>You said you have localized content, so why don't I see any?</h3>

<p>
You have to have your browser set to accept the language for the
localized content.  For example, if you look at the Singapore entries,
you'll need to have your browser set to accept Chinese to see the
localized data.
</p>

<p>
For Firefox, go to <code>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Advanced -&gt;
Languages</code> and click on <code>"Choose"</code>.
</p>

<p>
If you're stuck using that horrid thing Microsoft pretends is a web
browser, then we suggest upgrading to <a
href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a>.  If you don't want to
upgrade, then Windows users of Internet Explorer should go to <code>Tools
or View or Extras -> Internet Options -> (General) Languages</code>, and Mac
users should go to <code>Edit -> Preferences -> Web Browser ->
Language/Fonts</code>.
</p>

<p>
Opera users, all three of you, should go to <code>File -> Preferences
-> Languages</code>.
</p>

<p>
And finally, for the Safari users, language settings are determined by
your overall system settings, so go to <code>System preferences ->
International -> Language</code>.
</p>

<p>
Of course, if you don't have the proper fonts installed for the locale
in question, you'll probably just see funny box-shaped characters
everywhere.
</p>
</%def>

<%def .competition>
<h3>Why are you competing with [site X]?</h3>

<p>
There's a number of answers to this question.  Some of our reasons for
starting this site include:
</p>

<p>
We wanted a site that was easily maintained by a large group of
contributors. Many other sites make it ridiculously hard to add new
entries, suggest changes, or write reviews.
</p>

<p>
We wanted a guide that helped people become and stay veg. Some other
sites place restrictions on what can be entered.
</p>

<p>
We wanted to offer a completely non-commercial site. We wanted to
offer really cool features.
</p>

<p>
We believe in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">free software</a> and free
content (free as in freedom). The source for this site is available
via the <a href="/site/source">Source Code</a> link in the page
footer. Our content is <&| /lib/link/license.mas &>freely reusable and
re-distributable</&>.
