<p>
  All we currently ask of our partner organizations is that they promote
  VegGuide.org where it makes sense. This means linking to it from your
  website(s) as well as mentioning it in print literature the next time your
  revise any relevant literature.
</p>

<h2>Linking</h2>

<p>
  When linking to the site, please link to <a href="/">the front page</a>. You
  may <strong>also</strong> choose to link to a region listing with entries,
  like <a href="/region/13">the Twin Cities region</a>. Please don't link to a
  region that just contains other regions, like North America. This makes for
  a very confusing first experience.
</p>

<h2>Messaging</h2>

<p>
  We encourage partner organizations to talk about the site as something they
  own. Say "our online guide to ... VegGuide.org". We want your supporters to
  view the site as something that your organization is completely part of, not
  as a separate project.
</p>

<p>
  When naming the site, you can say either "VegGuide" or "VegGuide.org". The
  latter is a bit more cumbersome, but it includes the entire domain name,
  which makes it easier for people to find the site, especially if you're
  having a conversation.
</p>

<p>
  When promoting the site, there are several messaging points to
  emphasize. First, we want to emphasize that this is a world-wide guide, not
  just the US or North America. Second, we want to emphasize that is a
  directory for veg-friendly restaurants and shopping. The goal here is to
  make it clear that it's not just for 100% veg places, but for any place that
  helps people reduce their consumption of animal products.
</p>

<p>
  You can mention that the site is ad-free and not-for-profit, and always will
  be. The site exists to provide value for its users and reduce animal product
  consumption, not to promote a particular business or organization. Finally,
  you can talk about how the site is community-maintained, which means that
  anyone can add new entries, write a review, rate a place, or upload images.
</p>

<p>
  Please make a point of encouraging people to contribute to the site when you
  talk to them. Adding more contributors to the site makes it that much more
  useful for everyone.
</p>

<h2>Financial Commitment (there is none)</h2>

<p>
  Being a partner organization requires no financial commitment on your
  part. Currently, the site has no ongoing operating costs. If this changes in
  the future, we may ask you to contribute to hosting costs, but there will
  not be an obligation to do so. Operating costs are unlikely to ever exceed
  $1,000 per year in total.
</p>

<p>
  Compassionate Action for Animals has printed some VegGuide promo cards in
  the past, and may print more. If you would like some of your own, we could
  do a larger print run for partners who want to contribute to the cost of
  printing or you could take the design and print it yourself.
</p>

<h2>What You Get</h2>

<p>
  We will add your organization's logo and a link to your site on the bottom
  of every page. Logos are currently in alphabetical order, though this may
  change for aesthetic reasons, depending on the shape and size of each
  partner's logo.
</p>

<h2>Joining the Cabal</h2>

<p>
  The Cabal mailing list is a very low traffic list used for discussing
  decisions about the site. Partner organizations are welcome to have a
  representative on the list, but this is not required.
</p>

<p>
  The Cabal discusses topics like new partners, site policies, etc. Traffic is
  very low, usually 5-15 messages per month.
