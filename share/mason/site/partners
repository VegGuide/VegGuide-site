<p>
  This page describes the responsibilities and benefits of becoming a
  VegGuide.org partner organization. It also provides guidelines linking and
  messaging.
</p>

<h2>What You Get</h2>

<p>
  The most important thing you get is the opportunity to take credit for and
  promote a great resource for helping people eat fewer animal products. This
  site exists to help people as they transition towards a plant-based diet, as
  well as to support existing vegetarians and vegans.
</p>

<p>
  We will add your organization's logo and a link to your site on the bottom
  of every page. Logos are currently in alphabetical order, though this may
  change for aesthetic reasons, depending on the shape and size of each
  partner's logo.
</p>

<p>
  Compassionate Action for Animals is committed to keeping VegGuide.org
  ad-free and not-for-profit. This means that we will never show ads on the
  site. We will never offer to promote specific entries in exchange for
  funds. We will never ask users to pay for access to features or data. We do,
  however, ask users to donate, and those donations (such as they are) come to
  Compassionate Action for Animals.

  source code, all of the site's data is available for study, modification, or
  sharing. The only exception is personal information about our users, which
  is not shared with anyone except site admins.
</p>

<h2>Responsibilities</h2>

<p>
  The main thing we currently ask of our partner organizations is that they
  promote VegGuide.org where it makes sense. This means linking to it from
  your website(s) as well as mentioning it in print literature the next time
  your revise any relevant literature.
</p>

<p>
  Partners are also invited to participate in the governance of the site. This
  may include decisions about how to promote the site, when to spend money on
  it, and where that money comes from.
</p>

<h3>Financial Commitment (there is none)</h3>

<p>
  Being a partner organization requires no financial commitment on your
  part. Currently, the site has no ongoing operating costs. If this changes in
  the future, we may ask you to contribute to hosting costs, but there will
  not be an obligation to do so. Operating costs are unlikely to ever exceed
  $1,000 per year in total.
</p>

<p>
  In the future, we may want to raise money to more actively promote the site,
  pay for design work, hire programmers, etc. By becoming a partner, you can
  have a voice in how we raise money and how we spend that money.
</p>

<h3>Joining the Cabal</h3>

<p>
  The Cabal mailing list is a very low traffic list used for discussing
  decisions about the site. Partner organizations are welcome to have a
  representative on the list, but this is not required.
</p>

<p>
  The Cabal discusses topics like new partners, site policies, etc. This is
  where decisions about the site are made. Traffic is currently very low,
  usually 5-15 messages per month.
</p>

<h2>Linking</h2>

<p>
  When linking to the site, please link to <a href="/">the front page</a>. You
  may <strong>also</strong> choose to link to a region listing with entries,
  like <a href="/region/13">the Twin Cities region</a>. Please don't link to a
  region that just contains other regions, like North America. This makes for
  a very confusing first user experience.
</p>

<h2>Messaging</h2>

<p>
  We encourage partner organizations to talk about the site as something they
  own. Say "our online guide to ... VegGuide.org". We want your supporters to
  view the site as part of your advocacy work.
</p>

<p>
  When naming the site, you can say either "VegGuide" or "VegGuide.org". The
  latter is a bit more cumbersome, but it includes the entire domain name,
  which makes it easier for people to find the site, especially if you're
  having a conversation.
</p>

<p>
  When promoting the site, there are several messaging points to
  emphasize. First, we want to emphasize that this is a world-wide guide, not
  just the US or North America. Second, we want to emphasize that is a
  directory for veg-friendly restaurants and shopping. The goal here is to
  make it clear that it's not just for 100% veg places, but for any place that
  helps people reduce their consumption of animal products.
</p>

<p>
  You can mention that the site is ad-free and not-for-profit, and always will
  be. The site exists to provide value for its users and reduce animal product
  consumption, not to promote a particular business or organization. Finally,
  you can talk about how the site is community-maintained, which means that
  anyone can add new entries, write a review, rate a place, or upload images.
</p>

<p>
  Please make a point of encouraging people to contribute to the site when you
  talk to them. Adding more contributors to the site makes it that much more
  useful for everyone.
