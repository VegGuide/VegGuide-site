as observed under apache2/mp2 under VMWare - 11-20

Starts off with just under 100MB shared

After a few requests gets to around 75MB shared, 25MB private

Add 10MB to be conservative

75MB + ( 12 * 35MB ) = 495MB

front ends use almost nothing (1.5MB shared, 1.5MB private)

50 front end procs max = 75MB
