<p>

RegVeg can now support different "skins" via different hostnames.
This means that other veg*n/AR groups can create their own customized
look and feel for regveg.  For an (ugly) example of this, see <a
href="http://skintest.vegguide.org/">skintest.vegguide.org</a>.  Want
to have your own skin?  <a href="/contact.html">Let us know</a>.
