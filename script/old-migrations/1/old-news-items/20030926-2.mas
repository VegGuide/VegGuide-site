<a href="http://www.vegparadise.com/">Vegetarians in Paradise</a>, an
online veg magazine for Los Angeles, generously gave us permission to
import all of their restaurant listing data into the guide.  As a result
we've just added over 60 new entries in the LA area.  Thanks very much
to Vegetarians in Paradise!
