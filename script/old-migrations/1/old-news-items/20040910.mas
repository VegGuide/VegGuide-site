Layout Changes

<p>
In order to encourage people to get involved as contributors, we've
made some layout changes<!-- TRUNCATE --> which hopefully make the add and edit links
more intuitive.  This involved removing all of the links in the
left-side boxes, which you probably already noticed.  We're using the
space freed up by that to display a "random tip" box instead.
