Spell Checking

<p>
I love you, users, but you cannot spell<!-- TRUNCATE -->.  So now
submissions will be spell checked and you'll be given a chance to make
corrections before the final submission.

My personal favorite misspelling so far, seen from more than one user,
was "vegitarian" instead of "vegetarian"!
