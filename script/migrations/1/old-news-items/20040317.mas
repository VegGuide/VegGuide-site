New domain: VegGuide.org

<p>
So people told us that they wanted to spread the word about the guide,
but that whenever they told someone the site name verbally, the person
they were telling didn't understand what they were saying.  Thus, we
have a new domain, <b>vegguide.org</b>.  Hopefully this one is easier
to say and hear.  The old domain, regveg.org, will remain usable for
quite some time, so don't panic.
