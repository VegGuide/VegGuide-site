New "is it open?" Feature
</%method>

<%method body>
<p>
It is now possible to filter a location's listing so that it only
shows entries that are open for the next hour from the current time.
Additionally, when viewing an entry, the details box on the right says
"open for the next hour" if this is the case.
</p>

<p>
Of course, this only works with entries for which we have hours, so
please make sure to enter them when creating new entries.
