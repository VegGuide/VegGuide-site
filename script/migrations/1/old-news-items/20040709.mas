<p>
The data feeds have changed their structure a bit.  Please see the <a
href="/rss/data_feed.html">data feed page</a> for details.  In
addition, it's now possible to get a combined "recent entries/reviews"
feed for a location.  Finally, you can get feeds for parent locations,
so you can get a feed for New York City that will include updates to
Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, etc.
